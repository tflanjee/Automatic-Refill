# Automatic-Refill
Pseudocode for the automatic refill proposed project.
Note that the main branch is the code for if a flow switch is used (which would save cost over a flow meter)
Note that the switch-to-flowmeter branch is the code for if a flow meter is used (more expensive but could be used for billing later too)
